## Public
A collection of cources, lectures, articles and presentations given for MIPT students as a part of Computer Science education sessions.

## Acknowledgements
Most of the courses which would be added to the collection is a joint work of several generations of Intel engineers and interns, reading CS lectures for MIPT BS students in [iLab](https://mipt-ilab.github.io/) (Students Lab of Intel and Milandr) and for MIPT MS students as a part of their education in [Department of Microprocessor Technologies](https://mipt.ru/drec/about/ilab/).

Digital Design course is based on the lectures of [Alexander Titov](https://github.com/alexander-titov). Great courses and articles by Alexander could be found [here](https://github.com/alexander-titov/public).

## Content
List of available courses:
* [Digital Integrated Circuits Design](https://github.com/igorsmir-ilab/public/tree/master/digital_design) - this course gives intro to the basics of IC design with the focus on performance-power-cost trade-offs appearing in front of engineers designing high-performance ICs for general purpose compute systems.
